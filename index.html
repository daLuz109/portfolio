                        <h2>ImunoCell</h2>
                        <img src="images/imunocell.gif" alt="ImunoCell gameplay" class="project-summary-gif">
                        <p>This is a highscool project. The idea is that you are a white cell and have to fight against invasors like viruses and bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Part of the project was to show how games can help you learn, and for that reason, I wanted to make it very accurate.</p>
                        <p>The overall feel of the game is inspired by games like Hotline Miami, so it feels very smooth.</p>
                        <p>This project gave me a lot of experience on Gamemaker Studio, but mostly on game design and art.</p>

                        <h2>Catwitch</h2>
                        <img src="images/catwitch.gif" alt="Catwitch gameplay" class="project-summary-gif">
                        <p>My favorite project! This is a story-focused game with a bit of horror mixed in. You are a cat who's also a witch and you have to hunt for ingredients and make potions for the dog soldiers.</p>
                        <p>I decided to limit the art to only 4 colors, mostly because I think it looks cool, but also because I wanted to see what I could do with limited resources.</p>
                        <p>This project, again, gave me a lot of experience on Gamemaker, game design and art, but I also made music for this one.</p>

                        <h2>Cleavage</h2>
                        <img src="images/catwitch.gif" alt="Cleavage gameplay" class="project-summary-gif">
                        <p>This one is a Minecraft mod, a bit unconventional for a portfolio but I think it's important to be shown.</p>
                        <p>On this mod you have a bunch of different gems which can be crafted using a new ore, and each one of them has its own set of 3 abilities.</p>
                        <p>The main reason of putting this here is because I learned a lot about java while making it.</p>

            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>I started making music around 2022 for fun. I mostly make video-game music (since my dream is to make games), but I've also exeperimented on some other genres.</p>
            <p>Here are some of my personal favorites:</p>
            <h2>Purple Rain</h2>
